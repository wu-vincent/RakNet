IO Completion Ports require Windows NT 3.5, 2000, or XP.

IO Completion Ports is a Windows mechanism that notifies and wakes a thread when asynchronous IO completes. This is more efficient than creating one thread per IO operation and blocking until completion. Instead, a pool of threads (two per processor in this case) blocks on the IO completion port; when an IO operation completes, one thread wakes and performs the next operation. This benefits servers with hundreds to thousands of players. For games with only a few players, it may be slower due to Windows overhead.

RakNet pools the IO completion port worker threads. Therefore, multiple instances of servers and clients on one computer will all share the worker threads. This improves efficiency in cases such as running multiple servers on one machine, or a client and a server on the same machine.

## Enabling IO Completion Ports

To enable IO completion ports, define the preprocessor symbol `__USE_IO_COMPLETION_PORTS` and rebuild all. To disable them, do not define this symbol. The included pre-built DLLs do not use IO completion ports, ensuring broad Windows compatibility. To build with IO completion ports, load the sample project at `Samples\Project Samples\CreateDLLSampleProject`, define `__USE_IO_COMPLETION_PORTS`, and build.

## Using a Shared Webhost to List Games

The [Lightweight Database](/plugins/lightweight-database) plugin is powerful but requires a dedicated RakNet server instance. When running a dedicated server is unnecessary or undesirable, RakNet provides `DirectoryServer.php`, found under `Samples\PHPDirectoryServer`.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Upload the PHP script

Upload `Samples\PHPDirectoryServer\DirectoryServer.php` to a PHP-capable webhost (any standard shared webhost). Navigate to the uploaded webpage, click the reveal button, and enter a password and other settings as needed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up TCPInterface

Create an instance of `TCPInterface` that is started. This is used for general TCP communication:

```cpp
TCPInterface tcp;
tcp.Start(0, 64);
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up HTTPConnection

Create an instance of `HTTPConnection`. This is used to communicate with webpages through `TCPInterface`:

```cpp
HTTPConnection httpConnection(tcp, "yourdomain.com");
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up PHPDirectoryServer

Create an instance of `PHPDirectoryServer`. This does parsing and communications that are specific to `DirectoryServer.php`:

```cpp
PHPDirectoryServer phpDirectoryServer(httpConnection, "/raknet/DirectoryServer.php");
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set fields and upload/download

Set columns, upload your table, or download existing tables:

```cpp
// Set fields with columnname / value
phpDirectoryServer.SetField("beehive", "inthewater");

// Upload previously set fields, along with required parameters:
// game name, game port, and password
phpDirectoryServer.UploadTable(50, "Game name", 1234, "");

// Download uploaded servers
phpDirectoryServer.DownloadTable("");
```

</Step>
</Steps>

To update the system, pass packets from `TCPInterface` to both interfaces and call `Update()`. TCP packets may not contain a complete webpage response, the webpage may return error codes, and not all messages from the webpage are relevant to the directory server. The sample demonstrates the full approach. The following is an abbreviated excerpt:

```cpp
Packet *packet = tcp.Receive();
if (packet) {
    if (packet->systemAddress == httpConnection.GetServerAddress()) {
        if (httpConnection.ProcessFinalTCPPacket(packet)) {
            int code;
            RakNet::RakString data;
            if (httpConnection.HasBadResponse(&code, &data) == false) {
                HTTPReadResult readResult = phpDirectoryServer.ProcessHTTPRead(httpResult);
                if (readResult == HTTP_RESULT_GOT_TABLE) {
                    char out[10000];
                    const DataStructures::Table *games =
                        phpDirectoryServer.GetLastDownloadedTable();
                    games->PrintColumnHeaders(out, sizeof(out), ',');
                    printf("COLUMNS: %s\n", out);

                    for (unsigned i = 0; i < games->GetRowCount(); i++) {
                        games->PrintRow(out, sizeof(out), ',', true, games->GetRowByIndex(i, NULL));
                        printf("ROW %i: %s\n", i + 1, out);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    tcp.DeallocatePacket(packet);
}
httpConnection.Update();
phpDirectoryServer.Update();
```

## Reserved Columns

Certain columns are reserved and returned in query results. These column names cannot be used by the end-user and trigger an assertion if attempted:

| Constant | Description |
|---|---|
| `__GAME_NAME` | Contains the name of the game, passed to `UploadTable()` |
| `__GAME_PORT` | Contains the port of the game, passed to `UploadTable()` |
| `__SEC_AFTER_EPOCH_SINCE_LAST_UPDATE` | When this row was last updated |
| `__DELETE_ROW` | Command to delete a row (internal) |
| `__PHP_DIRECTORY_SERVER_PASSWORD` | Password passed to the PHP server (internal) |
| `__GAME_LISTING_TIMEOUT` | How long to list this server before auto expiring (internal) |

`__SYSTEM_ADDRESS` is also returned, indicating the external IP used to upload to the webpage.

<Callout type="info">
Due to technical limitations, only one upload can be processed at a time. This is not an issue if your server hosts a single game. Calling `PHPDirectoryServer::UploadTable()` while an upload is pending overwrites the prior upload. Perform another upload only when `HTTPConnectionIsBusy()` returns `false`.

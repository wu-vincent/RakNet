## Log incoming and outgoing messages for debugging

The `PacketLogger` plugin prints all incoming and outgoing messages for debugging. It parses the message where necessary, indicating if a message is an RPC or a timestamp. It also converts the numerical `MessageID` into the corresponding string. The output by default is comma-delineated, readable as a CSV file, and goes to the console with `printf()`.

To change the output destination, derive from `PacketLogger` and override `WriteLog()`.

Aside from `PacketLogger` itself, the following implementations are already included:

-   **`PacketConsoleLogger`** - For use with the `ConsoleServer`.
-   **`PacketFileLogger`** - Logs to a file. Call `StartLog()` to open the file.
-   **`ThreadsafePacketLogger`** - Same as `PacketLogger`, but delays `WriteLog()` until out of the RakNet thread. Use this if you do anything significant with the logs (anything other than `printf`).

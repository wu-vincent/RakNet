## Cloud hosting through Rackspace

<Callout type="info">
Services such as the [autopatcher](/plugins/autopatcher) require a server running RakNet. Technically, [NATPunchthroughServer](/plugins/nat-punchthrough) does as well, although a free server was previously provided. While it is possible to run your server using a traditional host, such as Hypernia, these services will cost you about $150 USD a month. Scaling up the services also requires time-consuming installation of the codebase and it is not possible to do so programmatically.
</Callout>

RakNet was tested with two cloud hosting providers: Amazon AWS and Rackspace Cloud. Amazon AWS did not work reliably with incoming UDP connections, and loopback performance using the BigPacketTest project was poor. Rackspace did not have these problems, and the cost for their lowest-end Linux servers is low. RakNet also includes a [C++ interface to Rackspace](/basics/rackspace-interface) for programmatic server control, making it a practical starting point.

**Creating the server**

The first step is to create a server, using Hosting / Cloud Servers / Add Server. This brings up a menu asking whether you want Linux or Windows and how much RAM. The low-end Linux servers are cheaper than the Windows servers. RakNet works with either. Cloud server and NAT punchthrough server both take minimal RAM. The Autopatcher takes significant RAM, however: four gigabytes to serve 256 concurrent users, or eight gigabytes to serve 512.

Once your server has been created, you receive an email with the password and login IP.

For Windows 7, enter the username, password, and login IP using Remote Desktop, found under Start / Accessories.

**Setting up the server**

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install a web browser

The default installation contains Internet Explorer, which you can use to download Firefox or Chrome.

</Step>

<Step>

### Download RakNet

Use that web browser to download RakNet.

</Step>

<Step>

### Install a compiler

On Windows, you can download Visual C++ 2010 Express for free. Installation requires a reboot.

</Step>

</Steps>

Once your server is set up, open the RakNet solution and compile normally. You now have a working server at the IP address you connected to via Remote Desktop.

**Backing up and scaling the server**

Once you have the server set up the way you want it, create an image of the server, which is essentially a hard drive backup. This is important for scalability because you can create a new instance of the server with the same configuration as your image.

<Callout type="warn">
When you are not running your server, be sure to delete the instance and leave the much cheaper image. Unlike Amazon AWS which only charges for usage, Rackspace charges as long as your server exists at all.

To start your server again, or to start multiple instances of the same server, use the Cloud Servers menu under My Server Images.

## Directory Delta Transfer Overview

### Send file differences between directories automatically

DirectoryDeltaTransfer.h is useful if you allow user-moddable content. For example, if each server has a /skins directory, you could run this plugin to upload that directory to the clients. Each client that does not already have a particular skin will get it. You will get download progress notifications via a user-supplied callback. DirectoryDeltaTransfer relies on the FileListTransfer plugin to actually transmit hte files.

Usage:

1.  Attach the plugin and connect to the remote system
2.  Server and client: Call `directoryDeltaTransfer.SetFileListTransferPlugin(&fileListTransfer);`
3.  Server: set the application directory: `directoryDeltaTransfer.SetApplicationDirectory("c:\myGame");`
4.  Server: set the download directory: `directoryDeltaTransfer.AddUploadsFromSubdirectory("skins");`
5.  Client: to download call: `directoryDeltaTransfer.DownloadFromSubdirectory("skins", "downloaded\\skins", true, serverAddress, &transferCallback, HIGH_PRIORITY, 0);`
6.  Client: Wait for the callback member `OnFileProgress()`. When onFileStruct->fileIndex is equal to onFileStruct->setCount this download is done.

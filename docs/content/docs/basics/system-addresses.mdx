## What are `SystemAddress`es?

`SystemAddress`es are structs containing the binary IP address and port of a system on the network. The structure is defined in `RakNetTypes.h`. Here are cases where you need `SystemAddress`:

-   The server received a message from a particular client and wants to relay it to all other clients. Specify the sender `SystemAddress` (from the `Packet::systemAddress` field) in the `Send` function with broadcast set to true. An item in the game world, such as a mine, belongs to a particular player and you want to give the appropriate person points for the kill.
-   You want to send a message to any peer on a peer to peer network.

**Utility functions:**

`ToString()` - Given a system address structure, return a dotted IP address.

`FromString()` - Given a dotted IP address, fill out the `binaryAddress` part of the structure.

**Important Considerations:**

1. The recipient of a packet automatically knows the `SystemAddress` of any system that sends a packet to it because it determines this from the sender's IP/Port combination. The sender does not need to encode its own `SystemAddress` in the data structure if all you need is for the server to know what the `SystemAddress` is. The `SystemAddress` of the originating sender is automatically passed to the programmer in the `Packet` structure that is returned by `Receive`.

2. When using the client server model, clients DO NOT know the `SystemAddress` of who originally sent the packet. As far as a client is concerned all packets originate with the server. Therefore if it is necessary that a client know the `SystemAddress` of another client you must add a `SystemAddress` field into the data struct. You can either have the sending client fill this field in, or you can have the server fill it out when it gets the packet from the original sender.

3. The system address for a particular instance of `RakPeer` does not change over the course of the connection, with the exception of the [Router2](/plugins/router2) plugin. However, it is not necessarily the same as seen by all other systems (such as when behind a symmetric NAT). For a unique identifier, use `rakNetGUID`, found in the `Packet` structure. `RakPeerInterface` has functions to operate on `RakNetGUID`.

<Callout type="info">
Prefer referring to remote systems by `RakNetGUID` instead of `SystemAddress`. `RakNetGUID` is a unique identifier for an instance of `RakPeer`, while `SystemAddress` is not. You must use `RakNetGUID` exclusively if you plan to use the [Router2](/plugins/router2) plugin.

## Network Simulator Overview

If you are using RakNet locally, chances are you will not have real-world problems like packet loss and ping fluctuations. RakNet provides some functions to simulate those problems.

## Network Simulator Functions

### ApplyNetworkSimulator

```cpp
ApplyNetworkSimulator(double maxSendBPS, unsigned short minExtraPing, unsigned short extraPingVariance)
```

Enables simulated ping and packet loss to the outgoing data flow. To simulate bi-directional ping and packet loss, you should call this on both the sender and the recipient, with half the total ping and `maxSendBPS` value on each.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `maxSendBPS` | Maximum bits per second to send. Packet loss grows linearly. `0` to disable. |
| `minExtraPing` | The minimum time to delay sends. |
| `extraPingVariance` | The additional random time to delay sends. |

### IsNetworkSimulatorActive

```cpp
bool IsNetworkSimulatorActive(void)
```

Returns whether you previously called `ApplyNetworkSimulator`.

## Limit incoming messages by category

With client/server topologies, you do not usually want any system to send any message. For example, perhaps only the server can send kill messages. Or perhaps you want to segment players into stages, where players who have logged on but not yet provided their password cannot yet send game messages. The message filter is designed to deal with these situations automatically.

The `MessageFilter` plugin defines categories of users by `filterSet`, a numerical identifier you supply. For example, you may have one filter set for newly connected systems and another for authenticated systems. For each filter set you can:

1.  Automatically add new connections
2.  Allow RPC calls
3.  Limit what messages, or ranges of messages, can be received, and what actions to take if this condition is violated (kick/ban/notify)
4.  Delete them

**Example:**

```cpp
messageFilter.SetAutoAddNewConnectionsToFilter(0);
messageFilter.SetAllowMessageID(true, ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM, ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM, 0);
messageFilter.SetAllowMessageID(true, ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM + 1, ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM + 1, 1);
```

This setup automatically adds all new connections to filter set 0 and only allows the message `ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM` to arrive. It also creates a new filter set, with the `filterSet` id 1, that only allows `ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM+1` to arrive.

<Callout type="info">
**Messages that are always allowed (filtering them has no effect):**

`ID_CONNECTION_LOST`, `ID_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION`, `ID_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION`, `ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED`, `ID_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_FAILED`, `ID_NO_FREE_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS`, `ID_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_MISMATCH`, `ID_CONNECTION_BANNED`, `ID_INVALID_PASSWORD`, `ID_MODIFIED_PACKET`, `ID_PONG`, `ID_ALREADY_CONNECTED`, `ID_ADVERTISE_SYSTEM`, `ID_REMOTE_DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION`, `ID_REMOTE_CONNECTION_LOST`, `ID_REMOTE_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION`, `ID_DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS`
</Callout>

See _Samples/MessageFilter_ for a complete sample. See `MessageFilter.h` for a complete list of all documented functions and parameters.

title: "Ogre 3D Interpolation Demo"
description: Demonstrates 3D interpolation and ReplicaManager3 using Ogre 3D to render popcorn popping.
---

The Ogre 3D interpolation demo uses the graphics engine Ogre 3D to render popcorn popping.

The server manages a set of popcorn kernels that pop and fly around. After a short interval, all the popcorn is deleted and respawned.

The client is purely visual -- it performs no physics and does not handle the details of spawning or popping the corn kernels.

## What It Demonstrates

**Specific to Ogre:**

How to interpolate between the real and visual positions using the helper class `TransformationHistory`. Given a past timestamp, it returns the interpolated position at that time. Hold down space to see the client run without interpolation -- the result is noticeably choppy, as updates are sent only 4 times per second. Release space and the display is smooth again.

**Covered as part of RakNet:**

`ReplicaManager3`, which automatically handles networking for creation, destruction, and serialization of the popcorn kernels.

## Running the Demo

<Steps>

<Step>

### Start two instances

Start two instances on the same computer.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the server

Press 's' for server on one instance.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the client

Press 'c' for client on the other.

</Step>

<Step>

### Toggle interpolation

Hold down space to see the client run without interpolation.

## Dependencies

<Callout type="warn">
Ogre 3D must be installed. It assumes you have `OGRE_SDK` as an environment variable. If not, change the project properties accordingly.

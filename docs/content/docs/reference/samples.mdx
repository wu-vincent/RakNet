## Autopatcher

**AutopatcherClient / AutopatcherServer** -- _Intermediate_

The autopatcher samples demonstrate the autopatcher system. Start one instance of `AutoPatcherClient` and one of `AutoPatcherServer`. The server uses the provided `PostgreRepository` class to store application files in a PostgreSQL database.
The client (`AutopatcherClient`) is agnostic to the server's storage mechanism -- it requests patches for applications.

## Basic Tests

**BitPacketTest** -- _Beginner_

This sample tests the packet splitting capabilities of RakNet. All it does is send a large block of data to the feedback loop.

**BitStream** -- _Beginner_

This sample demonstrates how to write and read bitstreams. It is contained in one program and uses RPC to transmit data. It writes a string and some numbers and shows how to read branching data.

## Chat and Networking

**Chat Example Client / Chat Example Server** -- _Beginner_

A simple chat server and client. Unlike a real game, it encodes strings directly into the data stream and reads them out directly. A production implementation uses packet IDs instead. Static data transmits the name and message of the day. To test, run one instance of the server and two or more instances of the client.

**Client File Verification** -- _Intermediate_

This sample reads all files in the Debug directory, generates a 20-byte SHA-1 hash for each, and sends the hashes over the network. If the client and server hashes match, the files are intact. This provides a basic file-integrity check, though additional measures are needed to prevent in-memory modification or post-check tampering.

**CommandConsoleClient / CommandConsoleServer** -- _Intermediate_

`CommandConsoleClient` demonstrates connecting to the command console using the RakNet transport protocol -- the equivalent of a secure telnet client.
`CommandConsoleServer` demonstrates the command console server, which can run standalone or as part of a game server. It parses text strings sent from a client via either secure RakNet or Telnet.

## Compression and Data Transfer

**Compression** -- _Intermediate_

This sample demonstrates the global compression scheme in RakNet. Start two or more instances, passing nothing when prompted for frequency tables. Chat for a while to train the data. After quitting, save the frequency tables when prompted. The server sends its frequency table to the clients, and one client sends its table to the server. For better accuracy, sum the frequencies from all clients and send the combined table. Restart the program and enter the generated files when prompted. Chat again, and on quit, statistics show the bandwidth savings from compressed data.

**DirectoryDeltaTransferTest** -- _Intermediate_

This sample demonstrates the plugin for incrementally transferring compressed deltas of directories -- a lightweight autopatcher.
Unlike the full autopatcher, it has no dependencies. It is suitable for patching from non-dedicated servers at runtime.

## Connection and Mesh Tests

**ConnectionGraph** -- _Beginner_

This sample demonstrates the connection graph plugin, which is used to maintain a list of all connections on the network.

**Dropped Connection Test** -- _Intermediate_

This test randomly starts and stops connections for n clients, where n is configurable via a define at the top of the file. Because all clients run in the same executable on one machine, the n threads created may degrade performance.

**FullyConnectedMesh** -- _Beginner_

This project tests and demonstrates the fully connected mesh plugin. No data is sent; it serves primarily as a usage example for the plugin system.

**LANServerDiscovery** -- _Beginner_

Sends an offline ping to everyone at IP "255.255.255.255". All active servers on a LAN should respond with a pong.

## Performance and Filtering

**LoopbackPerformanceTest** -- _Intermediate_

The loopback performance test is useful for discovering implementation flaws and measuring efficiency. It has many parameters but provides defaults for all of them. Start 3 instances of the program and enter 1, then 2, then 3 when prompted. Accept defaults for all other parameters if desired. Detailed statistics are displayed during runtime and at the end of the test.

**MessageFilter** -- _Beginner_

Demonstrates the use of the `MessageFilter` plugin to filter all incoming messages, and only allow messages of a certain type.

## NAT and RPC

**NATPunchThrough** -- _Intermediate_

Shows how to use the `NatPunchthrough` plugin to connect two systems that are both behind NATs.

**ObjectMemberRPC** -- _Advanced_

Shows how to make RPC calls on object methods. Run two instances: one as a server and one as a client.
Familiarity with [NetworkIDObject](/basics/network-id-object) is expected.

## Offline and Logging

**OfflineMessagesTest** -- _Beginner_

This project tests the advertise system and offline ping messages.

**PacketLoggerTest** -- _Intermediate_

Shows how to use the `PacketLogger` class to display all packets being sent or received.
Derive from `PacketLogger` and override `PacketLogger::WriteLog()` to render output in your own program.

**Ping** -- _Beginner_

Starts a server, then a client, then does an unconnected ping between the two.

## Voice and Replication

**RakVoice / RakVoiceFMOD** -- _Intermediate_

These two projects show how to integrate `RakVoice` with a sound engine. `RakVoice` sample shows how to integrate with portaudio, and `RakVoiceFMOD` shows how to integrate with FMOD sound engine.
This uses peer to peer connections between all chatting systems.
See [RakVoice](/plugins/rakvoice) for more details.

**ReplicaManagerCS / ReplicaManagerP2P** -- _Advanced_

Shows how to use the `ReplicaManager` class in a Client/Server environment or P2P. `ReplicaManager` is a very lightweight and efficient system that provides object creation, destruction, and serialization updates such that you have all copies of all desired objects on all desired systems semi-automatically.
See [ReplicaManager](/plugins/replica-manager) for more details.

## Reliability and Routing

**Reliable ordered test** -- _Beginner_

Continually sends packets using reliable ordered from a sender to a receiver. The receiver checks the packet data to make sure the packets arrived in order.

**Remote Procedure Calls** -- _Intermediate_

Shows how to send a message to the server using RPC, and then relay that message back to the client via RPC.

**Router** -- _Advanced_

Demonstration of the `Router` plugin. The `Router` plugin exposes a `Send()` function allowing you to send to systems you are not directly connected to.

## Static Data and Timestamps

**ServerEnumeration and StaticClient Data** -- _Intermediate_

A client connects to a server and static data is shared between them. This sample covers all functionality associated with this and shows the more complex cases where you want to update data on the other system or only change data locally.

**Timestamping** -- _Beginner_

In this sample, a sender writes the timestamp identifier and a timestamp into a byte stream and sends it to a recipient. It demonstrates how RakNet will automatically modify the timestamp so that it is system relative.

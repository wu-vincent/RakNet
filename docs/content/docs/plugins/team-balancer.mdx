### Request and balance teams client/server or peer to peer

The TeamBalancer plugin is used to assign each player in a game session a team number. Players by default have no team, and join teams by calling `RequestSpecificTeam()` or `RequestAnyTeam()`.

Operations include:

- **SetTeamSizeLimits()** -- Define the maximum number of players that can join a given team number.
- **SetDefaultAssignmentAlgorithm()** -- Define how to automatically add new players to a team -- either filling teams in order, or joining the smallest team. This is triggered by a call to `RequestAnyTeam()`.
- **SetForceEvenTeams()** -- Cause all teams to be evenly balanced. Teams with too many players will have players randomly moved to teams with too few players.
- **RequestSpecificTeam()** -- Change to a requested team. If this team is full, your join will be pending, until either that team is not full, or a player on the desired team wants to switch with your team.
- **CancelRequestSpecificTeam()** -- If `RequestSpecificTeam()` has not yet completed, this will remove that request.
- **RequestAnyTeam()** -- Join a team randomly, based on the default team assignment algorithm.
- **GetMyTeam()** -- Return which team I am on, if any.
- **SetAllowHostMigration()** -- Call with `true` for peer to peer, otherwise call with `false`.

See the header file `TeamBalancer.h` for more information and complete documentation of each parameter and function, as well as messages returned to the user.

_See the sample project Samples\\TeamBalancer for an implementation of this system._

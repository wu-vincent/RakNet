description: Remotely control a game server via Telnet or secure RakNet transport.

Sometimes it is useful to control a server when you are not in front of that particular computer. This can arise due to server hosting, where the host is located offsite. Or perhaps you have many servers, and you want to control them via a script. The `ConsoleServer`, `CommandParserInterface`, and `TransportInterface` are three classes that work together to meet these needs.

## Architecture

**ConsoleServer**

The `ConsoleServer` class, located at `ConsoleServer.h`, contains a list of `CommandParserInterface` classes, added with `ConsoleServer::AddCommandParser()`. By calling `ConsoleServer::Update()` once per game tick, all `CommandParserInterface` classes are processed for incoming input.

**CommandParserInterface**

A command parser is a class which operates on a named set of registered commands. `CommandParserInterface` is a base class from which you should derive functionality for each command parser. For example, `RakNetCommandParser.h` exposes most functions that are available to call in `RakPeerInterface`. `RakNetTransportCommandParser` exposes functions that deal with the `RakNetTransport` class, used to actually send data used by the `ConsoleServer`.

**TransportInterface**

The `TransportInterface` class provides functionality to the `ConsoleServer` to send strings. There are currently two implementations of `TransportInterface`: `TelnetTransport`, and `RakNetTransport`. `TelnetTransport` uses [TCPInterface](/utilities/tcp-interface) to reply to a remote telnet terminal. `RakNetTransport` sends strings through an instance of `RakPeer`, with [secure connections](/basics/secure-connections) enabled.

## Putting It All Together

Excerpts from the sample `CommandConsoleServer`:

```cpp
ConsoleServer consoleServer;
TelnetTransport tt;
RakNetCommandParser rcp;
LogCommandParser lcp;
```

```cpp
consoleServer.AddCommandParser(&rcp);
consoleServer.AddCommandParser(&lcp);
consoleServer.SetTransportProvider(ti, port);
lcp.AddChannel("TestChannel");
```

```cpp
while (1) {
    lcp.WriteLog("TestChannel", "Test of logger");
    consoleServer.Update();
    // Game loop here
}
```

It's quite simple in practice. You have one instance of a console server, one instance of a transport interface (either `TelnetTransport` or `RakNetTransport`), and your command parsers. Call `ConsoleServer::AddCommandParser` for each parser, `ConsoleServer::SetTransportProvider()` for telnet or RakNet, and `ConsoleServer::Update()` once per tick. Here we also add an output channel to the `LogCommandParser`, and output to the log once per tick.

Assuming the server is already started, you can connect as follows:

**Start telnet from the start menu**
![Start Telnet](/images/telnet1.jpg)

**Connect to your server with telnet**
![Connect to localhost](/images/telnet2.jpg)

**The system should handle everything else**

## RakNetTransport

### Secure Console Connections

Telnet is easy to use but not secure. If you want to send passwords or other sensitive data, you should use `RakNetTransport` on the server instead. This comes with an additional command parser, `RakNetTransportCommandParser`, which adds the functionality to change the password on the instance of `RakPeer` that is internal to `RakNetTransport`. It was designed this way so remote users connect to the command parser without connecting to the game itself, and the game and the command parser can have different passwords.

For the client-side, the sample `CommandConsoleClient` is an implementation of a console application that uses RakNet to connect to `RakNetTransport`.

## Creating Your Own Command Parser

To add a new command parser, derive a class from `CommandParserInterface`, as was done in `RakNetCommandParser.h`. You will want to override `OnCommand`, `GetName`, and `SendHelp`. Additionally, any functionality you need to communicate with your game, such as `SetGamePointer()` or `SetLogger()`, you should add on your own.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Register commands

In the constructor of your new class, call `RegisterCommand` for each command you want to add. Here is an example from `RakNetCommandParser.cpp`:

```cpp
RegisterCommand(4,
                "Startup",
                "( unsigned short maxConnections, int _threadSleepTimer, "
                "unsigned short localPort, const char *forceHostAddress );");
```

The first parameter (`4`) is the number of parameters to pass to the function. The second parameter (`"Startup"`) is the name of the command, and will show up in the abbreviated command list. The third parameter defines the `helpString`, displayed when help is called on a particular named command.

Given this syntax, `ConsoleServer` will verify that the correct number of parameters was passed, and return an error to the user should this not be the case.

</Step>

<Step>

### Implement OnCommand

In `OnCommand()`, compare the command string to your registered commands, and take the desired action:

```cpp
if (strcmp(command, "Startup") == 0) {
    SocketDescriptor socketDescriptor((unsigned short)atoi(parameterList[1]), parameterList[3]);
    ReturnResult(peer->Startup((unsigned short)atoi(parameterList[0]), atoi(parameterList[2]),
                               &socketDescriptor, 1),
                 command, transport, systemAddress);
}
```

The return value of `OnCommand` is currently not used, so just return `true`. `ReturnResult` is a function you can optionally call that will return a string to the requesting system.

</Step>

<Step>

### Implement GetName

Return the name of your command parser. This will show up in the command parser listing.

</Step>

<Step>

### Implement SendHelp

Return extended help when queried for your particular parser. If your parser is not runnable due to failed preconditions, it is a good idea to return a notification message about that here.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Advanced Options

**Unknown or variable number of parameters:**

Pass `CommandParserInterface::VARIABLE_NUMBER_OF_PARAMETERS` as the first parameter to `RegisterCommand`. `ConsoleServer` will not check for a valid number of parameters in this case. It is up to you in `OnCommand()` to deal with error conditions that may come up.

**Direct string parsing:**

If you don't want `ConsoleServer` to parse the incoming string for you, use the parameter `originalString` passed to `OnCommand`. For example, if you are controlling your scripting system, you would probably want to pass this string directly along.

**Changing delimiters:**

If you want to separate your commands by something other than space, or separate your strings by something other than quotation marks, the defines are found in `CommandServer.cpp`:

```cpp
#define COMMAND_DELINATOR ' '
#define COMMAND_DELINATOR_TOGGLE '"'
```

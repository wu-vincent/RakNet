## Packet Logger Overview

### Log incoming and outgoing messages for debugging


The PacketLogger is a plugin that will print all incoming and outgoing messages for debugging. It parses the message where necessary, indicating if a message is an RPC, or a timestamp. It also converts the numerical MessageID into the corresponding string. The output by default is comma delineated, readable as a [CSV file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), and goes to the console with printf().

To change the output destination, derive from PacketLogger and override WriteLog();

Aside from PacketLogger itself, the following implementations are already included:

-   PacketConsoleLogger - For use with the ConsoleServer.
-   PacketFileLogger - Logs to a file. Call StartLog() to open the file.
-   ThreadsafePacketLogger - Same as PacketLogger, but delays WriteLog() until out of the RakNet thread. Use this if you do anything significant with the logs (anything other than printf).

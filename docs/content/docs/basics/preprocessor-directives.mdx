description: "Reference for all RakNet preprocessor defines that can be overridden in RakNetDefinesOverrides.h to customize behavior."
---

Define any of these values in RakNetDefinesOverrides.h to override. These are the defaults as set in RakNetDefines.h. Also see NativeFeatureIncludes.h to not compile in features you do not use.

| Define | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `__GET_TIME_64BIT` | `1` | Have RakNet::TimeMS use a 64-bit rather than 32-bit value. A 32-bit value overflows after about 5 weeks. Doubles bandwidth for sending times. Must be the same on all systems. |
| `_FILE_AND_LINE_` | `__FILE__,__LINE__` | Set to `"",0` to strip out file and line info for memory tracking from the EXE. |
| `__BITSTREAM_NATIVE_END` | commented out | Define to NOT support endian swapping in BitStream. Faster, but only use if all systems have the same endianness. |
| `MAX_ALLOCA_STACK_ALLOCATION` | `1048576` | Maximum stack size to use with `_alloca` before falling back to new and delete. |
| `USE_WAIT_FOR_MULTIPLE_EVENTS` | defined | Use WaitForSingleObject instead of sleep. Plays nicer with other systems and uses less CPU, but gives worse RakNet performance. |
| `_USE_RAK_MEMORY_OVERRIDE` | `0` | Enable RakMemoryOverride for custom memory tracking. See RakMemoryOverride.h. |
| `OPEN_SSL_CLIENT_SUPPORT` | `0` | Enable OpenSSL for TCPInterface. Required for SendEmail with Google POP servers. Requires OpenSSL header search paths. |
| `BITSTREAM_STACK_ALLOCATION_SIZE` | `256` | Threshold at which to do malloc/free rather than pushing data onto a fixed stack for the BitStream class. |
| `RAKNET_DEBUG_PRINTF` | `printf` | Redefine to disable or change the target for debug RAKNET_DEBUG_PRINTF. |
| `MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_INTERNAL_IDS` | `10` | Maximum number of local IP addresses supported. |
| `DATAGRAM_MESSAGE_ID_ARRAY_LENGTH` | `512` | Controls memory used per connection. If more than this many datagrams are sent without an ack, the ack has no effect. |
| `RESEND_BUFFER_ARRAY_LENGTH` | `512` | Maximum number of reliable user messages that can be on the wire at a time. |
| `_LINK_DL_MALLOC` | commented out | Link in the DLMalloc library for use with RakMemoryOverride. |
| `GET_TIME_SPIKE_LIMIT` | `0` | If two calls between RakNet::GetTime() happen farther apart than this time in microseconds, this delta is returned instead. Set to non-zero to enable. |
| `USE_SLIDING_WINDOW_CONGESTION_CONTROL` | `1` | Use sliding window congestion control instead of ping-based congestion control. |
| `PREALLOCATE_LARGE_MESSAGES` | `0` | Preallocate memory for entire large message blocks on arrival. Faster reassembly but vulnerable to memory exhaustion attacks. |

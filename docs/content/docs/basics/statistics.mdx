### How to read and interpret RakNet's statistical data

Statistical data is important for an online game because it lets you see where your traffic bottlenecks are.

`RakPeerInterface` provides the structure `RakNetStatistics` which is returned by the `GetStatistics()` function present in `RakPeerInterface`. This structure is defined in _Source/RakNetStatistics.h_. The function `StatisticsToString` is also provided which will convert these statistics to a formatted buffer.

<Callout type="info">
A running total is kept for the following enumerations. Use `StatisticsToString()` for a human-readable formatted output of all statistics.
</Callout>

```cpp
/// How many bytes per pushed via a call to RakPeerInterface::Send()
USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_PUSHED,
```

```cpp
/// How many user message bytes were sent via a call to
/// RakPeerInterface::Send(). This is less than or equal to
/// USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_PUSHED. A message would be pushed, but not yet sent, due
/// to congestion control
USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_SENT,
```

```cpp
/// How many user message bytes were resent. A message is resent if it is marked
/// as reliable, and either the message didn't arrive or the message ack didn't
/// arrive.
USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RESENT,
```

```cpp
/// How many user message bytes were received, and returned to the user
/// successfully.
USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RECEIVED_PROCESSED,
```

```cpp
/// How many user message bytes were received, but ignored due to data format
/// errors. This will usually be 0.
USER_MESSAGE_BYTES_RECEIVED_IGNORED,
```

```cpp
/// How many actual bytes were sent, including per-message and per-datagram
/// overhead, and reliable message acks
ACTUAL_BYTES_SENT,
```

```cpp
/// How many actual bytes were received, including overhead and acks.
ACTUAL_BYTES_RECEIVED,
```

If you want to track statistics over time, we also provide _Source/StatisticsHistoryPlugin.h,_ used by the sample _StatisticsHistoryTest_. It tracks values for some user-defined amount of time and does various calculations on the data set. `RakPeerInterface::GetStatistics()` is read automatically. Here is sample code that tracks a sin and cos wave.

```cpp
DataStructures::Queue<StatisticsHistory::TimeAndValue> histogram;
StatisticsHistory::TimeAndValueQueue *tav;
StatisticsHistory::TimeAndValueQueue tavInst;
StatisticsHistory statisticsHistory;
statisticsHistory.SetDefaultTimeToTrack(10000);
statisticsHistory.AddObject(StatisticsHistory::TrackedObjectData(HO_SIN_WAVE, 0, 0));
statisticsHistory.AddObject(StatisticsHistory::TrackedObjectData(HO_COS_WAVE, 0, 0));
while (1) {
    double f = (double)((double)GetTime() / (double)1000);
    statisticsHistory.AddValueByObjectID(HO_SIN_WAVE, "Waveform", sin(f), GetTime(), false);
    statisticsHistory.AddValueByObjectID(HO_COS_WAVE, "Waveform", cos(f), GetTime(), false);
    RakSleep(30);
}
```

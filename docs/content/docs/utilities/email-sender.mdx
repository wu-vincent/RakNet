title: "Email Sender"
description: Simple C++ class to send emails through a mail server, including Gmail POP support.
---

`EmailSender`, found at `EmailSender.h`, exposes a single function, `Send(...)`, to send an email through a specified mail server. The [CrashReporter](/utilities/crash-reporter) class uses it internally to send emails for unmonitored servers. See `EmailSender.h` for a full description of each parameter.

See the project `Samples/SendEmail` for a working example.

<Callout type="info">
`EmailSender` also works with Gmail POP servers, so you can send emails without running your own mail server. The sample includes the required settings by default. You must also uncomment `OPEN_SSL_CLIENT_SUPPORT` in `RakNetDefines.h`, as Gmail requires SSL for TCP connections.

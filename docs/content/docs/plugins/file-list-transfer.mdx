## FileListTransfer Overview

### Send and receive file(s) more easily

The FileListTransfer plugin is designed to send a list of files that have been read into the **FileList** class. It is similar to the [DirectoryDeltaTransfer](/plugins/directory-delta-transfer) plugin, except that it doesn't send deltas based on pre-existing files or actually write the files to disk. It solely handles the networking part of sending files.

Usage:

1.  Server: Call SetupReceive(...) with the address of a system to allow a file send, and a **FileListTransferCBInterface** derived callback handler to be called as the data arrives.
2.  Client: Encode the files you want to send into the **FileList** class.
3.  Client: Call Send(...) with your **FileList** class instance, a user-defined ID to identify this set of files, parameters to pass to RakPeerInterface::Send() or TCPInterface::Send(), and a boolean indicating if the files should be compressed or not. Compression is not very fast, so it's best to leave that off unless bandwidth is at a premium.

## FileList Overview

The FileList class stores a list of files and data, and also contains utility functions for dealing with the harddrive in general. It was originally written for the [Autopatcher](/plugins/autopatcher), but can be used for your own purposes as well.

See FileList.h for a complete description of all functions and parameters.

```cpp
/// Add all the files at a given directory.
void AddFilesFromDirectory(const char *applicationDirectory, const char *subDirectory, bool writeHash, bool writeData, bool recursive, unsigned char context);
```

```cpp
/// Deallocate all memory
void Clear(void);
```

```cpp
/// Write all encoded data into a bitstream
void Serialize(RakNet::BitStream *outBitStream);
```

```cpp
/// Read all encoded data from a bitstream. Clear() is called before deserializing.
bool Deserialize(RakNet::BitStream *inBitStream);
```

```cpp
/// Given the existing set of files, search applicationDirectory for the same files.
/// For each file that is missing or different, add that file to missingOrChangedFiles. Note: the file contents are not written, and only the hash if written if alwaysWriteHash is true
void ListMissingOrChangedFiles(const char *applicationDirectory, FileList *missingOrChangedFiles, bool alwaysWriteHash, bool neverWriteHash);
```

```cpp
/// Return the files that need to be written to make \a input match this current FileList.
void GetDeltaToCurrent(FileList *input, FileList *output, const char *dirSubset, const char *remoteSubdir);
```

```cpp
/// Assuming FileList contains a list of filenames presumably without data, read the data for these filenames
void PopulateDataFromDisk(const char *applicationDirectory, bool writeFileData, bool writeFileHash, bool removeUnknownFiles);
```

```cpp
/// Write all files to disk, prefixing the paths with applicationDirectory
void WriteDataToDisk(const char *applicationDirectory);
```

```cpp
/// Add a file, given data already in memory
void AddFile(const char *filename, const char *data, const unsigned dataLength, const unsigned fileLength, unsigned char context);
```

```cpp
/// Add a file, reading it from disk
void AddFile(const char *filepath, const char *filename, unsigned char context);
```

```cpp
/// Delete all files stored in the file list
void DeleteFiles(const char *applicationDirectory);
```

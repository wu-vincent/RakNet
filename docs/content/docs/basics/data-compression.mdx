## Data Compression Overview

RakNet can automatically compress all your outgoing data and decompress your incoming data. To do this, it needs a "sample" frequency table for your average game so it can pre-compute how to encode the data to get maximum savings. Here is the general process:

1. Run a sample "average" game. Get the frequency table for the server and for one of the clients (or average all the clients if you want).
2. Generate the decompression layer for the server from the client's frequency table.
3. Generate the compression layer for the server from the server's frequency table.
4. Generate the decompression layer for the client from the server's frequency table.
5. Generate the compression layer for the client from the client's frequency table.

After that everything is handled automatically.

See `Samples\Compression` for a full example.

## Data Compression Functions

### SetCompileFrequencyTable

```cpp
SetCompileFrequencyTable(bool doCompile)
```

Enables or disables frequency table tracking. This is required to get a frequency table, which is used in `GenerateCompressionLayer()`. This value persists between connect calls and defaults to false (no frequency tracking). You can call this at any time — however you should only call it when disconnected. Otherwise you will only track part of the values sent over the network.

### GenerateCompressionLayer

```cpp
GenerateCompressionLayer(unsigned long inputFrequencyTable[256], bool inputLayer)
```

This is an optional function to generate the compression layer based on the input frequency table, which you get with `GetOutgoingFrequencyTable`. You should call this twice — once with `inputLayer` as `true` and once as `false`. The frequency table passed here with `inputLayer=true` should match the frequency table on the recipient with `inputLayer=false`, and vice versa. Calling this function when there is an existing layer will overwrite the old layer.

### DeleteCompressionLayer

```cpp
DeleteCompressionLayer(bool inputLayer)
```

Delete the output or input layer as specified. This is not necessary to call and is only valuable for freeing memory. You should only call this when disconnected.

### GetOutgoingFrequencyTable

```cpp
GetOutgoingFrequencyTable(unsigned long outputFrequencyTable[256])
```

Returns the frequency of outgoing bytes into the output frequency table. The purpose is to save to file as either a master frequency table from a sample game session for passing to `GenerateCompressionLayer()`. You should only call this when disconnected. Requires that you first enable data frequency tracking by calling `SetCompileFrequencyTable(true)`.

### GetCompressionRatio

```cpp
float GetCompressionRatio()
```

Returns a number `n > 0.0f` where lower numbers are better. `n == 1.0f` means your data is no smaller or greater than the original. This shows how effective your compression rates are.

### GetDecompressionRatio

```cpp
float GetDecompressionRatio()
```

Returns a number `n > 0.0f` where higher numbers are better. `n == 1.0f` means the incoming data was decompressed to be just as large as it was when it came in. This shows how effective your compression rates are.

description: "How to set up RakNet in your project using source files, a DLL, or a static library."
---

RakNet includes the source, along with the projects to make the DLL and static lib, and samples. It no longer includes pre-built DLLs or libraries - this is due to incompatibilities across compilers. We recommend using the source directly, however you can also use the DLL or static lib projects to build your own.

Projects to build the DLL/Static Lib, and the samples, are provided for Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003 and 2005. Users of other compilers will have to make their own projects.

<Tabs items={["Source (Recommended)", "DLL", "Static Lib"]}>
<Tab value="Source (Recommended)">
## Using the Source Directly

This is the recommended approach. It avoids DLL/lib compatibility issues across compilers.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Add source files

Add the files under the /Source directory to the project. While not all of these are strictly necessary, the ones you don't use won't hurt you.

</Step>

<Step>

### Link Winsock

Import ws2_32.lib, or wsock32.lib if you don't have Winsock 2 installed. In MSVC 7 you can right click on the project, select configuration properties / linker / input / additional dependencies and type "ws2_32.lib" in there.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set runtime library

Set your project to use multi-threaded runtime libraries. In MSVC 7 you can right click on the project, select configuration properties / C/C++ / Code Generation / Runtime Library and change it to Multi-threaded (/MT).

</Step>

<Step>

### Set include path

Set an additional include path to include the RakNet source (if you copied the source files to a different directory).

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure preprocessor directives

Optionally set your [preprocessor directives.](/basics/preprocessor-directives)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Using a DLL

### Creating a DLL

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a DLL project

I'll assume you know how to do this. In MSVC 7 you would create an empty project, then under Application Settings you check DLL and empty project.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add source files

Add the source files under the /Source directory to the project.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set include path

Add to "Additional Include Directories" your directory with the source files.

</Step>

<Step>

### Link Winsock

Import ws2_32.lib, or wsock32.lib if you don't have Winsock 2 installed. In MSVC 7 you can right click on the project, select configuration properties / linker / input / additional dependencies and type "ws2_32.lib" in there.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set runtime library

Set your project to use multi-threaded runtime libraries. In MSVC 7 you can right click on the project, select configuration properties / C/C++ / Code Generation / Runtime Library and change it to Multi-threaded (/MT).

</Step>

<Step>

### Add DLL preprocessor definition

Add `_RAKNET_DLL` to the Preprocessor Definitions. In VS Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> PreProcessor -> Preprocessor Definitions.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set character set

Set the character set to "not set". In VS Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> General -> Character Set.

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure preprocessor directives

Optionally set your [preprocessor directives.](/basics/preprocessor-directives)

</Step>

<Step>

### Build the DLL

Then hit F7 or the equivalent to build your DLL and Lib.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Game Setup

1.  Copy the DLL you just created to your game in the same directory as the exe. The lib can be in any directory you want.
2.  Add the .lib to your project
3.  Add all header files from /Source to your project

</Tab>
<Tab value="Static Lib">
## Using a Static Library

Building a static library follows the same general steps as building a DLL, but you create a Static Library project type instead.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a static library project

In MSVC, create a new project and select "Static Library" as the project type.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add source files

Add the source files under the /Source directory to the project.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set include path

Add to "Additional Include Directories" your directory with the source files.

</Step>

<Step>

### Link Winsock

Import ws2_32.lib, or wsock32.lib if you don't have Winsock 2 installed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set runtime library

Set your project to use multi-threaded runtime libraries (Multi-threaded /MT).

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure preprocessor directives

Optionally set your [preprocessor directives.](/basics/preprocessor-directives)

</Step>

<Step>

### Build

Build the static library. Then link it into your game project and add the RakNet header files to your include path.

</Step>

</Steps>

## 3rd party dependencies

### Projects that won't compile by default

Not all projects will build without installing 3rd party dependencies. These are not required to use the majority of RakNet, however you will be missing specific features or demos without them.

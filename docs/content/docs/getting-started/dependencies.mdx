<Callout type="info">
All dependencies listed on this page are **optional**. You can use RakNet without any of them. They are only needed if you want to build specific plugins or demos.
</Callout>

What follows is a list of projects that will not build without 3rd party dependencies, and where to get these dependencies. These projects are optional: you can use RakNet without them. Unpack to is where the project, library, and/or post build step paths are set to by default for the Visual Studio project, and can be changed manually.

### RPC3

Remote procedure calls using C++ and semi-automatic serialization. Includes support for networked [signals and slots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots). Note: The majority of boost is not required, only those files actually used by RPC3. If you don't want to use Boost, you can use the RPC4 plugin instead which has similar functionality to the RPC found in RakNet version 3.

_Download from_: http://www.boost.org/users/download/

_Unpack to_: c:/boost_1_48_0

Note: You can use RPC4 if you do not want to install Boost, it however cannot call directly into C++ member functions or automatically serialize method parameters.

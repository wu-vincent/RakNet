### Use Steamworks to join Lobbies, Rooms, and do NAT traversal

The `Lobby2Client_Steam` plugin provides an interface to Steamworks services that cooperate with RakNet. This avoids the need to host your own server, which is otherwise required by RakNet's [NATPunchthrough](/plugins/nat-punchthrough) and [Lobby](/plugins/lobby) systems.

<Callout type="warn">
**Dependencies:**

1.  Assumes the Steam SDK is located at C:\\Steamworks. If not, modify the post-build step paths and linker paths accordingly.
2.  You can get the Steamworks API from https://partner.steamgames.com/, which requires a signup and legal agreement.
3.  You need your own `steam_appid.txt` file. This sample just copies the one that comes with Steam.

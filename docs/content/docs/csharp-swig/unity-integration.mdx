description: Integrate RakNet 4.x with Unity for advanced networking beyond the built-in RakNet 3.x.

## More Sophisticated Networking with Unity

[Unity](http://unity3d.com/) uses RakNet version 3.731. RakNet ships integrated into the Unity binary, so no separate download or license agreement is required.

For more sophisticated networking -- running your own server, more efficient MMO communication, or extending Unity's networking -- you can use RakNet version 4.x, which has [C# support](/csharp-swig/swig-tutorial). Unity supports C# game code, so you can write network code using RakNet directly and access its full feature set.

<Callout type="warn">
Unity does not include RakNet 4.x out of the box. A separate license was required to perform this upgrade.

- IPv6 support
- Better congestion control
- Better HTTP support
- `TeamManager` class, to automatically manage players across teams
- `StatisticsHistory` class
- HTTP-based lobby3 system, supporting leaderboards, achievements, friends, clans, etc.

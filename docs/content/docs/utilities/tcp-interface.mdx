title: "TCPInterface"
description: Utility class for TCP connections to Telnet, HTTP servers, mail servers, and more.
---

`TCPInterface`, found at `TCPInterface.h`, is a utility class designed to connect using the TCP protocol in cases where this is necessary. The connection process is similar to `RakPeerInterface.h`, with the exception that `Receive()` returns the actual data received -- the first byte does not contain any specific identifiers.

To get connection status updates, use `HasNewConnection()` and `HasLostConnection()`.

<Callout type="info">
There is no sample that uses the TCPInterface class specifically, but `TelnetTransport.cpp` is a good place to look for a reference.

## Functions

```cpp
// Starts the TCP server on the indicated port
bool Start(unsigned short port, unsigned short maxIncomingConnections);

// Stops the TCP server
void Stop(void);

// Connect to the specified host on the specified port
SystemAddress Connect(const char *host, unsigned short remotePort);

// Sends a byte stream
void Send(const char *data, unsigned length, SystemAddress systemAddress);

// Returns data received
Packet *Receive(void);

// Disconnects a player/address
void CloseConnection(SystemAddress systemAddress);

// Deallocates a packet returned by Receive
void DeallocatePacket(Packet *packet);

// Queued events of new connections
SystemAddress HasNewConnection(void);

// Queued events of lost connections
SystemAddress HasLostConnection(void);
```

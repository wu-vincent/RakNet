### Determine in advance if you can complete NAT punchthrough

[NAT punchthrough](/plugins/nat-punchthrough) success rate is based on what kind of algorithm the NAT uses.

**Full cone NAT**: Accepts any datagrams to a port that has been previously used. Will accept the first datagram from the remote peer.

**Address-Restricted cone NAT**: Accepts datagrams to a port as long as the datagram source IP address is a system we have already sent to. Will accept the first datagram if both systems send simultaneously. Otherwise, will accept the first datagram after we have sent one datagram.

**Port-Restricted cone NAT**: Same as address-restricted cone NAT, but we had to send to both the correct remote IP address and correct remote port. The same source address and port to a different destination uses the same mapping.

**Symmetric NAT**: A different port is chosen for every remote destination. The same source address and port to a different destination uses a different mapping. Since the port will be different, the first external punchthrough attempt will fail. For this to work it requires port-prediction (`MAX_PREDICTIVE_PORT_RANGE>1`) and that the router chooses ports sequentially.

**Success Graph**

| Router Type | *Full cone NAT* | *Address-Restricted cone NAT* | *Port-Restricted cone NAT* | *Symmetric NAT* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *Full cone NAT* | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| *Address-Restricted cone NAT* | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| *Port-Restricted cone NAT* | YES | YES | YES | NO |
| *Symmetric NAT* | YES | YES | NO | NO |

The `NatTypeDetection` plugins allow you to determine which type of NAT you have, and therefore if NAT punchthrough is likely to complete or not. This can be determined in advance of joining a game.

### NAT Type Detection algorithm

1.  Client opens two ports on the same IP address. In `NatTypeDetectionClient`, the RakNet socket is the first port, `c2` is the socket on the second port, created in `NatTypeDetectionClient::DetectNATType()`.
2.  Server opens two ports on one IP address, and one port on three additional IP addresses. This is done in `NatTypeDetectionServer::Startup()`. The first port on the first IP address is the normal RakNet socket. The second port on the first IP address is `s1p2`. The other three addresses are bound to the sockets `s2p3`, `s3p4`, and `s4p5`.
3.  Client connects to the server on the first IP address normally
4.  Client requests NAT type detection begins
5.  Server attempts to send to client's second port. This was a port that was never opened previously on the client, therefore if received, then the client is not behind a NAT. This is done in `NatTypeDetectionServer::Update()`, defined by `STATE_TESTING_NONE_1` and `STATE_TESTING_NONE_2`. The reason for 2 attempts is that every attempt occurs twice. The time for each attempt is the ping * 3 + 50 milliseconds. `s4p5` is used for this.
6.  Server sends from a different IP address to client's first port, the port that RakNet is connected on. If received, then the client will accept datagrams from any source IP address to a port already in use. This is therefore full-cone NAT. `s2p3` is used for this.
7.  Server sends from the second port on the already-connected IP address, `s1p2`. If received, then the client is using address-restricted cone NAT.
8.  Client sends to another IP address on the server, from its first (already connected) port. If the IP address and port is the same, then the client uses the same external IP address and port to all connections from the same source address. This is port-restricted NAT.
9.  Else symmetric NAT.

### Client Implementation

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create the plugin

Create an instance of the plugin: `NatTypeDetectionClient natTypeDetectionClient;`

</Step>

<Step>

### Attach to RakPeerInterface

Attach the plugin to an instance of `RakPeerInterface`: `rakPeer->AttachPlugin(&natTypeDetectionClient);`

</Step>

<Step>

### Connect to the server

Connect to the server, and wait for `ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED`: `rakPeer->Connect("8.17.250.34", 60481, 0, 0);`

</Step>

<Step>

### Start detection

Call `DetectNATType` with the `SystemAddress` of the server.

</Step>

<Step>

### Wait for result

Wait for `ID_NAT_TYPE_DETECTION_RESULT`.

</Step>

<Step>

### Read the result

Byte 1 contains the type of NAT that you have. See the enumeration `NATTypeDetectionResult` in `NATTypeDetectionCommon.h`.

</Step>

<Step>

### Use utility functions

Various utility functions are provided for this enumeration: `CanConnect()`, `NATTypeDetectionResultToString()`, `NATTypeDetectionResultToStringFriendly()`

</Step>
</Steps>

### Server Implementation

<Callout type="warn">
The server must have enough external IP addresses for the detection algorithm to work (at least 4 IP addresses). The server must not be behind NAT.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>

### Host a server

Host a server somewhere, not using NAT / e.g. behind a firewall.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create the plugin

Create an instance of the plugin: `NatTypeDetectionServer natTypeDetectionServer;`

</Step>

<Step>

### Attach to RakPeerInterface

Attach the plugin: `rakPeer->AttachPlugin(&natTypeDetectionServer);`

</Step>

<Step>

### Get IP addresses

Get a list of IP addresses on your system:

```cpp
char ipList[MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_INTERNAL_IDS][16];
unsigned int binaryAddresses[MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_INTERNAL_IDS];
SocketLayer::Instance()->GetMyIP(ipList, binaryAddresses);
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the server

Call `natTypeDetectionServer.Startup(ip2,ip3,ip4);` -- `ip2`, `ip3`, `ip4` must be IP addresses not already in use. If you bound RakNet to `ip1` in the call to `RakPeer::Startup()`, then use the 2nd to 4th indices in `ipList`.

</Step>
</Steps>

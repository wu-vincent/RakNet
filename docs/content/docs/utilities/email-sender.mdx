title: "Email Sender"
description: Simple C++ class to send emails through a mail server, including Gmail POP support.
---

The EmailSender class, found at `EmailSender.h`, is a simple class with only one function, `Send(...)`, to send an email using a provided mail server. It is used internally by the [CrashReporter](/utilities/crash-reporter) class to send emails for unmonitored servers. See `EmailSender.h` for a full description of each parameter.

See the project `Samples/SendEmail` for a sample of this.

<Callout type="info">
The class has also been tested to work with Gmail POP servers, so if you have a Gmail account you can send emails without using your own mail server. The sample has the settings you need by default. You will also need to uncomment `OPEN_SSL_CLIENT_SUPPORT` in `RakNetDefines.h`, as Gmail requires the TCP connection to be made with SSL.

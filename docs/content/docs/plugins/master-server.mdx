A master game server is a server that maintains a list of running game servers. It is effectively required because otherwise your players have no way to find other active games to connect to.

This is the sample implementation of a master game server using RakNet. There are many features you may wish to add on your own, as this is a minimal shell.

The code is class-based, one class for the master server and another for the master client, which your game uses to talk to the master server. To include this functionality, create one instantiation of `MasterServer` or `MasterClient` as appropriate.

`MasterServer` is typically a console application or a simple windowed application. To run it, call `Initialize()` once, then `Update()` once per frame. You can also derive and implement `OnModifiedPacket()` as needed. `MasterServerMain` contains test code that provides an excellent overview of the master server's capabilities. Host this on a domain name rather than a specific IP so you can change servers without forcing your players to update. For example, if your game's website is `mutantkillerfrogs.com`, you can code the `MasterClient` to connect to this domain, which resolves to an IP.

`MasterClient` is a client that game servers include and manage. Connect to a domain name rather than a specific IP (see above).

See `MasterClient.h`, `MasterServer.h`, and `MasterCommon.h` for full details on what the master server and master client can do.

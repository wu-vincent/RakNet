## Integrating with the Marmalade SDK

Marmalade is an SDK that enables you to write games for iOS and Android using native C++. It is not a game engine, although it includes graphics libraries and other tools. Because Marmalade compiles native C++, it can compile RakNet and therefore enables you to use RakNet on those platforms in a consistent way.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Download Marmalade

Download and install Marmalade Beta 5.1 or later. This requires registration and other steps with Marmalade.

</Step>

<Step>

### Create RakNet solution

With RakNet downloaded, go to DependentExtensions/Marmalade and double-click RakNet.mkb. If Marmalade is installed correctly, this creates a directory such as build_raknet_vc9. To add or remove RakNet source files, edit the .mkb and .mkf files where the RakNet source files are listed, then double-click the .mkb again.

</Step>

<Step>

### Build RakNet library

Find the .sln solution file in the directory created in step 2. Open it and build for all platforms you need. Build / Batch Build / Select All / Build accomplishes this as well. On success, object files are created in a directory such as DependentExtensions/Marmalade/build_raknet_vc9/Debug_RakNet_vc9_x86.

</Step>

<Step>

### Link RakNet to your application

Add these two lines to your application .mkb file

```text
option module_path="../../DependentExtensions/Marmalade"
subproject RakNet
```

Modify the path under option module_path to point to your RakNet installation. An example is available under Samples/Marmalade. After making this change, double-click the .mkb file to regenerate your project solution.

<Callout type="warn">
If, upon building RakNet, you get a build error "unresolved external symbol `_strtoull` ..." then you need to either update Marmalade to a newer version, or comment out the last `strtoull` in `RakNetGUID::FromString` in `RakNetTypes.h`, then build step 3 again.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Fix allocator

The Marmalade bucket system is not threadsafe. Be sure you have this code in main():

```cpp
#include "RakMemoryOverride.h"

void *MarmaladeMalloc(size_t size) {
    return s3eMallocBase(size);
}
void *MarmaladeRealloc(void *p, size_t size) {
    return s3eReallocBase(p, size);
}
void MarmaladeFree(void *p) {
    s3eFreeBase(p);
}
SetMalloc(MarmaladeMalloc);
SetRealloc(MarmaladeRealloc);
SetFree(MarmaladeFree);
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Referring to events on different computers in the same timeframe

A timestamp is the local system time. Every system has a different local system time. If you send the system time over the network, you get the value of the other machine's clock -- which tells you nothing about when the event happened, since you only know your own system time. RakNet's timestamping feature converts times to be relative to your own system, so you can focus on the game and not worry about remote system clocks. It does this transparently and automatically, with a high degree of precision even with fluctuating pings.

Suppose an event happens on a client where the local system time is 2000, the server's local system time is 12000, and another client's local system time is 8000. Without timestamp adjustment, the server receives the time 2000, which is 10000 ms ago from its perspective -- when the event actually happened roughly ping/2 ms ago (probably around 100 ms). Similarly, the other client receives 2000, which is 6000 ms ago from its own system time of 8000.

RakNet handles this for you, compensating for both system time and ping. Using relative time, the server sees that the event happened roughly ping/2 ms ago, and the other client sees the event happened roughly ping/2 ms (relative to each client) ago. In short, you can use timestamps directly as long as you encode your packets correctly.

See [Creating Packets](/basics/creating-packets) for instructions on how to encode timestamps into your packets.

<Callout type="info">
Use the time functions in `GetTime.h` for your system time, as this is a high-resolution timer. You can also use the Windows function `timeGetTime()`, but it is less accurate. Timestamping depends on automatic pinging, so call `SetOccasionalPing` to maintain accuracy.

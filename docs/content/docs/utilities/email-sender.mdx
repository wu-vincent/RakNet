## Email Sender Overview

### Simple class to send emails via C++


The EmailSender class, found at EmailSender.h, is a simple class with only one function, Send(...), to send an email using a provided mail server. It is used internally by the [CrashReporter](/utilities/crash-reporter) class to send emails for unmonitored servers. See EmailSender.h for a full description of each parameter.

See the project Samples/SendEmail for a sample of this

The class has also been tested to work with Gmail POP servers, so if you have a Gmail account you can send emails without using your own mail server. The sample has the settings you need by default. You will also need to uncomment OPEN_SSL_CLIENT_SUPPORT in RakNetDefines.h, as Gmail requires the TCP connection to be made with SSL.

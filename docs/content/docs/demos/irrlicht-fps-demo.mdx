The FPS demo uses the game engine Irrlicht to move actors and bullets around.

## Running the Demo

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install Irrlicht

Download [Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/), a free game engine. By default, it is assumed to be installed at `C:\irrlicht-1.6`.

</Step>

<Step>

### Build the project

In the solution, open Samples / 3D Demos / Irrlicht Demo. Right-click and build.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the demo

Run the built executable. Because the sample uses peer-to-peer connectivity, the NAT punchthrough server must be running.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Most of the network code is found in `RakNetStuff.cpp` under `DependentExtensions\IrrlichtDemo`. For a technical description of how the code was implemented, see `readme.txt` in that same directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
The demo uses a NAT punchthrough server. The jenkinssoftware.com server previously pointed to by `DEFAULT_NAT_PUNCHTHROUGH_FACILITATOR_IP` is no longer available. You can run your own server using the sample code found in the NAT punchthrough project.
</Callout>

The code is located at `DependentExtensions\IrrlichtDemo`.

## Dependencies

<Callout type="warn">
Irrlicht must be installed. It assumes it was installed to `C:\irrlicht-1.6`. It also requires irrKlang for sound, provided by default.

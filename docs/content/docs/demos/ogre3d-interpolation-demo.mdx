title: "Ogre 3D Interpolation Demo"
description: Demonstrates 3D interpolation and ReplicaManager3 using Ogre 3D to render popcorn popping.
---

The Ogre 3D interpolation demo uses the graphics engine Ogre 3D to render popcorn popping.

The server has a bunch of popcorn kernels, which pop and fly around. After a short while all the popcorn is deleted and respawned.

The client is a dumb client in that the client does not do any physics or handle the details of spawning or popping the corn kernels.

## What It Demonstrates

**Specific to Ogre:**

How to interpolate between the real and the visual position using a helper class TransformationHistory. Given a time in the past, it will tell you where you were then, using interpolation. If you hold down space you can see the client run non-interpolated, which is very choppy indeed, as it only sends 4 times a second. Let go of space and it's smooth again.

**Covered as part of RakNet:**

ReplicaManager3 class, which automatically handles the networking for creation, destruction, and serialization of the popcorn kernels.

## Running the Demo

<Steps>

<Step>

### Start two instances

Start two instances on the same computer.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the server

Press 's' for server on one instance.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the client

Press 'c' for client on the other.

</Step>

<Step>

### Toggle interpolation

Hold down space to see the client run without interpolation.

</Step>

<Callout type="info">
If you want to run it over the internet, change the hardcoded `SERVER_IP` variable to the server's address.

## Dependencies

<Callout type="warn">
Ogre 3D must be installed. It assumes you have `OGRE_SDK` as an environment variable. If not, change the project properties accordingly.

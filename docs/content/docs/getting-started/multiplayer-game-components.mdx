This page covers the major systems involved in building any multiplayer game, not just those using RakNet. RakNet-specific solutions are listed at the end of each section.
</Callout>

In the early days of gaming all you had was an IP address and a download. These days you have integration into 3rd party systems such as Steam, patching, voice chat, multiple game modes, cross-platform play, and more. I list some major systems by category below, along with the options available for solving these problems and pros and cons of each system.

## Discovering other systems

### Direct IP entry

The oldest and simplest method, this involves typing in the IP address of the user you want to connect to. The remote user can go to a page such as [http://www.whatismyip.com/](http://www.whatismyip.com/) to get their IP. They can then communicate this IP to you through other communication channels such as email or instant messenger. If the remote user is behind a router, they will have to open the appropriate ports on the firewall to accept incoming connections. If they are behind a firewall, they will have to configure the firewall as well.

### DNS entry

Applicable to client/server games where you control the servers, you can have a DNS entry point to the server. Connecting clients can then connect to the DNS entry rather than typing in a fixed IP address. This is useful if the IP address of the server may change. This service is available for free through [http://www.dyndns.com/](http://www.dyndns.com/). RakNet provides a class to update DynDNS as well, found in Source/DynDNS.h and Source/DynDNS.cpp. This is usually used for client/server games where you host your own server.

### LAN Broadcast

If the remote computer is on the same LAN, you can discover this computer by sending a datagram to the IP address 255.255.255.255 provided that the remote computer is listening on the port you send on, and will send a datagram in response. RakNet provides this through the Ping() and AdvertiseSystem() functions.

### Lobby server

Consoles such as the XBOX 360 and the PS3, and services such as Steam on the PC offer a lobby system. The lobby system also typically provides services such as DLC, achievements, friends, and rooms. RakNet provides the SteamLobby plugin, and rough equivalents on the XBOX and PS3 with their respective lobby classes. This is usually used for peer-to-peer games, where players have some significant interaction between each other before the game starts.

### Master server

Similar to the rooms server, a server maintains a list of running games. Typically, when an end-user starts a game, they upload statistics about the game to a master server, which allows queries on uploaded games. RakNet previously offered a hosted master server (masterserver2.raknet.com), but this service is now defunct. You would need to self-host a master server instead.

## Network topology

### Client/Server where you host the servers

Usually used for massively multiplayer games, you will host one or more servers that contain the game world(s) provided to the players. This is also the most expensive solution since you have to have dedicated servers with guaranteed uptime and pay for bandwidth yourself.

### Client/Server where users host the servers

This is used for games where if the server drops, so does the entire game session. It is nonetheless common because it has the following advantages:

1.  Easier to program because a single system can resolve contention between clients
2.  Can support a large number of players, because dedicated servers with a high bandwidth capacity can host
3.  Better for long-term gameplay sessions because a dedicated server is less likely to drop or cause problems
4.  Dedicated servers can be spread throughout the world, resulting in low-ping sessions

It is also possible to program client/server using an end-user as a host, but then you get all of the disadvantages of client/server without none of the advantages except ease of programming.

### Peer to peer

This is used for more informal game sessions without dedicated servers. It is the most common topology for console games since consoles do not allow dedicated servers. The only advantage is a dedicated host is not necessary. The disadvantages are:

1.  Still need a server of some sort to find running game sessions
2.  Have to punch through routers
3.  Have to deal with host migration
4.  Have to deal with contention. If two peers do the same mutually exclusive operation at the same time, how to resolve?

RakNet provides plugins to make peer to peer programming easier: [NATPunchthrough](/plugins/nat-punchthrough), [ReadyEvent](/plugins/ready-event), [ConnectionGraph2](/plugins/connection-graph), [FullyConnectedMesh2](/plugins/fully-connected-mesh2), and [TeamBalancer](/plugins/team-balancer). See the project ComprehensivePCGame in the RakNet solution for an example where all these plugins are combined together.

## Game and game design changes for networking

### Level loading

Rather than loading all objects in the level as done in single player, objects now need to be categorized according to how they influence networking

1.  Objects that still load normally are those that always exist in the level and are not referenced by network code.
2.  Objects may still load normally with the level, but need to be referred to by network code. For example, event triggers. These objects can either be loaded with a NetworkID (64 bit GUID), or the code at load time can gather these types of objects and assign them ids.
3.  Objects may or may not exist on level load need to be dynamically loaded. For example, such as players, spawned weapons, and bullets. Some of these objects should be preloaded during level load, on the assumption that they will eventually be spawned, to avoid runtime harddrive access.

Generally, after level load the game does not start until all players have finished loading. Even on consoles, the disk may be scratched so systems may take a different amount of time to load a level. Before considering level load complete:

1.  Transmit selections from other users that affect our load state. For example, what character models the other users picked
2.  Load the level as well as whatever models / textures, etc. are needed based on the other player's choices
3.  Stay on an intermission screen until all other players are also done loading. [ReadyEvent](/plugins/ready-event) can be used for this

Midgame joins are the same, except that you skip the intermission screen. However, if the game session ends while you are still loading, you should be able to cancel the load and enter whatever intermission state is shown at game end.

### Game Objects

<Callout type="info">
Objects that are networkable need to implement an interface to support [ReplicaManager3](/plugins/replica-manager3). The key requirements are listed below.
</Callout>

1.  Objects must be able to return an identifier for what type of class the object is, for example ENUM_BULLET or "CBullet" for a bullet.
2.  Object must be instantiable given that identifier and initialization data. Sometimes this is done through a class factory.
3.  Objects should implement an interface allowing them to serialize data for construction, destruction, and per-tick serialization
4.  Objects that are deleted when the owning user leaves the game session should support deletion. For example, if a remote user's avatar is deleted, this should not end the game session locally.

Game objects owned by the host or other users may need to support a partial-interactive ghost state where the object is rendered and animated but has typically has physics disabled and does not start triggers. However:

1.  Partial-interactive ghost objects may still cause sounds, such as footsteps on glass
2.  Partial-interactive ghost objects may still cause visual effect triggers

Whether an object is in a fully interactive state depends on whether a unique host is needed to resolve conflicts. Objects in the game world need to be categorized correspondingly based on bandwidth and gameplay considerations:

1.  Object is only fully interactive on the host, for example triggers that affect gameplay in some way.
2.  Object is fully interactive on all systems, for example a trigger that plays a particle effect
3.  Object is only fully interactive on the system that owns it, for example your own avatar.

### Host Migration

Host migration is needed for peer to peer games, where one system is host. While some platforms offer a system for host migration, we have a cross-platform solution [FullyConnectedMesh2](/plugins/fully-connected-mesh2)

### Users

In-game, a user class needs to be implemented, containing information such as score, name, user id, achievements, etc. Some games may support multiple users on the same system, for example split-screen play

### Remote Systems

A Remote system class may need to be implemented, containing information such as level load state or a trust metric for cheat detection. If the game only supports one user per system, this is sometimes rolled into the User class.

### Teams

If the game supports teams, this needs to be serialized including players, team score, etc. Team management is supported with the [TeamManager](/plugins/team-manager) plugin. It supports any network topology, offline teams, and advanced features such as switching requested teams.

### World / Game State

Not all game information is necessarily held by game objects, for example the match countdown. It can be represented using Replica3 as usual, or can be updated directly through network messages.

### Level End

When the host determines level end, the game needs to support the ability to pause gameplay, despawn all players, and show some kind of end-game score screen. During this phase score updates should be paused and other game events should halt. If session statistics are transmitted to a server, it can be done at this time.

### Spectating / Replay

Some games allow you to watch gameplay from the point of view of fixed cameras, other players, or a replay cam after death.

### Post-Game statistics and UI

After a game session, sometimes a series of UI screens are shown after the level has unloaded. After that, the game state may either go back to the game browser screen, or stay in a room with the users you just played with.

## Patching

### Per-file difference based patching

The most advanced but time consuming way to patch users is to find the difference between a file the user has and the current version of that file. Under those circumstances the smallest delta can be sent and applied to the file. If the patch fails (for example, an unknown version of the file) the entire file will need to be transmitted. A database of patches will need to be maintained for this solution, as generating the patch at runtime is too time consuming.

RakNet provides the [AutopatcherServer and AutopatcherClient plugins](/plugins/autopatcher) as a diff based patching system.

### Per-file patching

A simpler way to patch is to find a list of changed or missing files for a client and to send only those files. One advantage of this system is that it can be used by end-user hosted game servers. For example, if a game server has a map or skins that a connecting client does not, those files can be downloaded before the game starts.

RakNet provides the [FileListTransfer](/plugins/file-list-transfer) plugin to transfer lists of files, and the [DirectoryDeltaTransfer](/plugins/directory-delta-transfer) plugin to transfer lists of changed or missing files.

## Debugging

### Logging

Multiplayer games are hard to debug because a bug can be spread between two systems. For example, system A performs an action but system B does not see it, or sees it differently. The bug may be caused by latency, showing up only at certain loads. Performance or other issues may come up as the application scales with more users. While logging can help with all these problems, they are hard to correlate because the system times are different.

RakNet provides two logging solutions. The first is called [SQLite3LoggerPlugin](/plugins/sqlite3-logger-plugin), and is based on SQLite3 on a hosted server. All logs go to the same server, and are automatically correlated. The logs can be viewed in a viewer that supports SQLite although RakNet also provides a free and open source custom viewer called EchoChamber. Individual game and connectivity messages can be logged per system using the [PacketLogger](/plugins/packet-logger) plugin.

### Minidump

Because crashes can be hard to reproduce, Windows applications can produce minidump files. If you know what version of the code produced the crash, you can debug the crash as if you had a debugger connected at the time.

RakNet provides the [CrashReporter](/utilities/crash-reporter) system to make this easier. It provides additional functionality such as sending emails to the developer in the case of unattended servers.

## Persistent data

### Persistent user data

Games that persist data beyond a single session require a system to create user accounts. User accounts can store data such as game statistics, name, and logo. Users can also have friends, form clans, and perform other social tasks. In order to write such a system, a database backend is needed with a persistent server to store this data. The users should not be able to send arbitrary queries to the database, so the server will need code to form queries based on user inputs.

RakNet provides a system called [LobbyServer and LobbyClient](/plugins/lobby) to provide this kind of functionality for the PC. Steam, the PS3, and the XBOX already store this on their own backend. For those cases, RakNet uses the same [LobbyClient](/plugins/lobby) interface so as to provide a unified interface to all systems.

## Security

Popular competitive games will draw cheaters. Cheaters can attack the application by

1.  Modifying the EXE to send unauthorized data (sending kill messages)
2.  Modifying the EXE to view extra data (seeing through walls)
3.  Modifying datagrams in transmit to change data sent
4.  Replaying datagrams to simulate login or game events (running bots)
5.  Introducing latency to get a competitive advantage

The game should verify all inputs for sanity when possible. This will need to be done even if cheating is not a concern, since latency will also cause unusual inputs.

RakNet can automatically protect against attacks #3 and #4 with [secure connection](/basics/secure-connections) support. Solutions already exist for protecting the EXE from modification on the PC. Protecting against latency based cheating just takes smart design decisions, such as not trusting client/peer inputs.

`LightweightDatabaseServer` / `LightweightDatabaseClient` provides a simple way to implement a master game server. A master game server is a server that maintains a list of running game servers. It provides the same functionality as similar commercial utilities, at no extra charge.

There are just two classes you can use. One for the master game server (`LightweightDatabaseServer`), and one for the client (`LightweightDatabaseClient`), which your game should use to talk to the master game server. To include this functionality, just make one instantiation of `LightweightDatabaseServer` or `LightweightDatabaseClient` as appropriate.

Your master game server (which uses `LightweightDatabaseServer`) will generally be a console application or a simple windowed application, whose only purpose is to wait for game servers to inform they are available, or to reply to player systems who want to know what game servers are available.

`LightweightDatabaseServer` uses in-memory tables to manage the game servers. Just like in a real database, you can define what fields you want in a table. Check the documentation for `LightweightDatabaseServer::AddTable` and `LightweightDatabaseServer::GetTable`. Those functions return a table to which you can add columns (fields).

It's a good idea to host your master game server on a domain name rather than a specific IP so you can change servers without forcing your players to update. For example, if your game's website is `mutantkillerfrogs.com` you can code the `MasterClient` to connect to this domain, which will be resolved to an IP.

`LightweightDatabaseClient` is a client that game servers should use to inform the master game server they are available for use. That is done by connecting to the master game server and adding a new row in the master game server's table. Use `LightweightDatabaseClient::UpdateRow` for that.

Note you'll also use `LightweightDatabaseClient` for the player system to connect to the master game server, but just for queries to find available game servers.

See `Samples\LightweightDatabase` for full details on how to use those classes.

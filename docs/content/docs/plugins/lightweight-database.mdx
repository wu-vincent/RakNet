`LightweightDatabaseServer` / `LightweightDatabaseClient` provides a simple way to implement a master game server. A master game server is a server that maintains a list of running game servers. It provides the same functionality as similar commercial utilities, at no extra charge.

There are two classes you can use. One for the master game server (`LightweightDatabaseServer`), and one for the client (`LightweightDatabaseClient`), which your game uses to talk to the master game server. To include this functionality, create one instantiation of `LightweightDatabaseServer` or `LightweightDatabaseClient` as appropriate.

Your master game server (which uses `LightweightDatabaseServer`) is typically a console application or a simple windowed application, whose only purpose is to wait for game servers to report availability, or to reply to player systems that want to know what game servers are available.

`LightweightDatabaseServer` uses in-memory tables to manage the game servers. As with a real database, you can define what fields you want in a table. See the documentation for `LightweightDatabaseServer::AddTable` and `LightweightDatabaseServer::GetTable`. Those functions return a table to which you can add columns (fields).

Host your master game server on a domain name rather than a specific IP so you can change servers without forcing your players to update. For example, if your game's website is `mutantkillerfrogs.com`, you can code the `MasterClient` to connect to this domain, which resolves to an IP.

`LightweightDatabaseClient` is a client that game servers use to inform the master game server they are available. Connect to the master game server and add a new row in its table via `LightweightDatabaseClient::UpdateRow`.

Note that you also use `LightweightDatabaseClient` for the player system to connect to the master game server, but only for queries to find available game servers.

See `Samples\LightweightDatabase` for full details on how to use those classes.

## Connection Graph Plugin Interface Implementation

### Connection Graph Implementation Overview

The Connection Graph plugin maintains a graph of connections for the entire network, so every peer knows about every other peer. The graph of connections is updated as new systems connect or disconnect from the network.
You can optionally specify a password which you can use to allow certain systems to take part on the graph.

Connection Graph doesn't connect to the other involved systems. It just keeps an aupdated graph of the entire network. If you want all systems connected to each other, see [Fully Connected Mesh](/plugins/fully-connected-mesh2).

Returns the connection graph, stored as map of adjacency lists.

```cpp
DataStructures::WeightedGraph<ConnectionGraph::SystemAddressAndGroupId, unsigned short, false> *GetGraph(void);
```

## Send file differences between directories automatically

`DirectoryDeltaTransfer.h` is useful if you allow user-moddable content. For example, if each server has a `/skins` directory, you could run this plugin to upload that directory to the clients. Each client that does not already have a particular skin will get it. You will get download progress notifications via a user-supplied callback. `DirectoryDeltaTransfer` relies on the `FileListTransfer` plugin to transmit the files.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Attach the plugin and connect

Attach the plugin and connect to the remote system.

</Step>

<Step>

### Set the FileListTransfer plugin

Server and client: Call `directoryDeltaTransfer.SetFileListTransferPlugin(&fileListTransfer);`

</Step>

<Step>

### Set the application directory (server)

Server: set the application directory: `directoryDeltaTransfer.SetApplicationDirectory("c:\myGame");`

</Step>

<Step>

### Set the upload subdirectory (server)

Server: set the download directory: `directoryDeltaTransfer.AddUploadsFromSubdirectory("skins");`

</Step>

<Step>

### Download from subdirectory (client)

Client: to download call: `directoryDeltaTransfer.DownloadFromSubdirectory("skins", "downloaded\\skins", true, serverAddress, &transferCallback, HIGH_PRIORITY, 0);`

</Step>

<Step>

### Wait for completion (client)

Client: Wait for the callback member `OnFileProgress()`. When `onFileStruct->fileIndex` is equal to `onFileStruct->setCount` this download is done.

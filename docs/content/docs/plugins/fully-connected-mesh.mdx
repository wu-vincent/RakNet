<Callout type="warn">
**Deprecated:** This plugin has been superseded by [FullyConnectedMesh2](/plugins/fully-connected-mesh2), which adds verified join and host migration support.

## Automatically connect all peers in a peer to peer game

The fully connected mesh implementation reads connection messages from RakNet and attempts to connect to all systems on the network. On a new connection, it tells the remote system about all known systems. When that packet arrives, the remote system then attempts to connect to all those systems in turn. You can optionally specify a password to control which systems may join the mesh.

<Callout type="info">
The implementation requires that a `ConnectionGraph` plugin is also attached to the `RakPeer`.
</Callout>

```cpp
/// Set the password to use to connect to the other systems
void Startup(const char *password, int _passwordLength);
```

```cpp
/// Use the NAT punchthrough system to connect rather than calling directly
void ConnectWithNatPunchthrough(NatPunchthrough *np, SystemAddress _facilitator);
```

See _Samples/FullyConnectedMesh_ for a demonstration of this plugin.
